#Platform
It is the place you will make the maximum impact.

The location you will make the majority of your wealth.

You can live and travel everywhere, but you should concentrate your wealth building efforts in one niche.

I had a conversation with a Chairwomen of a medical technology company yesterday.

She shared her plans of sculpting a platform, better yet empire, for her daughter.

After 2 years of market research and pulling connections, the business is finally manifesting. 

As soon as the daughter completes her Master's Degree, she will take over the business.

Sounds like something straight out of a drama, but this how the elite lay down the ground work for the next generation in China.

I wonder why I was surpised of this notion at all.

It's natural and everyone should have a plan and place to make maximum impact.

Shouldn't this be our priority?

# Wasting 10 Years is Wasting 30 Years

She repeated this **4 times**.

**Our 20s should be spent building the skills neccessary to maximize our 30s.**

We simply can't afford to let our 30s go to waste.

Whatever you do in your 20s, make sure you are building career capital, which you can then direct to your platform.

You'll get the hang of things eventually, and ultimately reek the benefits.
