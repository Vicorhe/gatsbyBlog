**Glimpse of My Thoughts One Day**

_This is tough, I've never worked with electical circuits, not to speak of sensors._

_This benign tip left us looking into an entirely different approach._

_We've spent the previous two months honing skills in computer vision and machine learning, hoping this would be our vehicle to success._

_The proposal does make sense though._

_After all, this is coming from someone with a couple more years' experience in our field._

_Let me take a shot at it._

_An hour, two hours, a morning, half a day..._

_Why can’t I find a ready made solution online?_

_Do I really have to solder electronics? I'm not comfortable with that._

_Gosh, how much time will this take?_ 

_I don’t know._

_I don’t think my partner would be too fond of this new trajectory?_

_I'll let this sink in for a couple of hours._

_Hit the gym, have lunch, a nap, a light meditation session, clean up the workspace._

_A soft reset._

_Let's look at that wall of chrome tabs._

_Hmm, this type of sensor seems to meet our requirements._

_Let’s note a couple of search terms._

_And magically, I seem to have gotten out of a rut._

Today is November 5th, the date of my original flight back to the States.

While holding a job in the States is no easy task, it comes with some degree of certainty, in other words, comfort.

Right now, I am blessed to start a business with the complete support of my mother's side of the family.

They know too well what can be acheived once you put everything on the line.

While I've yet to reach a flat out failure, I've yet to accomplish anything either.

Many times, I've contemplated taking the 'easy way' out and settle for a stable job.

Today marks the day I sealed that path.

This path will be long, treacherous, vague.

There will be no guarantee of success.

The only guarantee is that it will benifit me in some way, after I give it my all.

When in doubt, perservere.
