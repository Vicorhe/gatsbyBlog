Backcasting is working backward from a positive future. Imagining a successful future and backcasting from there is a useful time-travel exercise for identifying necessary steps for reaching our goals.

Inspired during my listen of Thinking in Bets, I decided to apply this practice to my current venture. 

**HEADLINE: Victor has captured large market share in the industry 4.0 movement. Having built a solid reputation through several high profile projects, Victor has a sea of opportunity to cherry pick his next project.**

- Victor mustered all his will power to persist through each trial during the first few gigs.

- Though compensation wasnâ€™t guaranteed, Victor made the most of out his early projects, mastering skills that would come in handy down the road.

- On some occasions, Victor went above and beyond and achieved more than his self assigned workload to ride the flow.

- Victor held himself accountable by keeping tally of where his time was spent. Enabling him to catch himself whenever he wasted too much time.

- Victor started eaach day fresh and free from the guilt of previous setbacks.

- Victor communicated often with his partner to keep each other up to date and on target.

- Victor kept his emotions out of the equation on most occasions.

- Victor channeled all his efforts into areas he had control over (his actions and responses to external events) and let everything else happen.

- Victor accepted that there were some matters outside of his control: whenever possible, he made the most out of spontaneous excursions by clocking in productive chunks of time here and there.
