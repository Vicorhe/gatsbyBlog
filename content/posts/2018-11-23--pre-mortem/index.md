From Wikipedia, a Pre-Mortem is 'a managerial strategy in which a project team imagines that a project or organization has failed, and then works backward to determine what potentially could lead to the failure of the project or organization.'

Inspired during my listen of Thinking in Bets, I decided to apply this practice to my current venture. 

**HEADLINE: Victor concludes his Chinese entrepreneurial venture to fall back to pursuing a regular 9-5 job. He wrote off his stay in China as an extended post graduation vacation.**

- Far too often, Victor slept in and jeopardized his momentum for that day.

- Victor failed to complete his first assignment after only giving a couple of straightforward attempts.

- Overwhelmed by mountains of perceived tasks, Victor felt paralyzed, he chose to ignore his work obligations and indulge in distractions.

- Victor never got the hang of accurately estimating his capabilities, and he got frustrated with himself often.

- Victor carried all the guilt from previous failures to each day, voluntarily discounting his further efforts and making his situation more difficult.

- Whenever Victor lost interest with a task, he would switch his direction. Gradually, his attention was spread too thin.

- When faced with an obstacle, Victor sought a way out instead of working through it. 

- Having a reputation for failing to follow through on projects, Victor didnâ€™t receive further ones.

- Victor was too afraid to operate in uncertainty, so much so that an upstart monopolized his submarket before Victor could make a dent.
