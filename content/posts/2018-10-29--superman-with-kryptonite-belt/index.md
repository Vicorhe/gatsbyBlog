- this video describes spot on my current mentality
- I haven’t been making progress lately yet I believe I am a rockstar
- the excuse is fear of the implications for when I succeed
- _it is totally within my power to build a successful startup, its just that the implications for when I succeed seem too permanent_
- I might end up living long term in China (not my preference, currently)
- borrowing Jon’s metaphor, I see myself as superman with a kryptonite belt
- if i didn’t have this belt (read, fear of implications), I could succeed in anything
- in reality, I am inadequate and have been deceiving myself
- the proposed remedy is to completely accept that I am a complete novice right now
- only then there is room to improve
