- To achieve extraordinary results, one often needs to do less with more focus.

- Find your one thing and give it your undivided attention.
- Success is sequential, one success leads to the next.
- Multitasking is a myth, you can only focus on one thing at a time.
- Manage your finite discipline to build the few necessary habits, or default behaviors for when you lack the willpower.
- Work life balance doesnâ€™t facilitate achieving extraordinary results.
- Never go too far into one end such that you cannot return, counterbalance.
- Never neglect an aspect of your life for long periods of time.
- Work is often more resilient to neglect than any other aspect of life.
- You are bound to drop something, so take what matters to the extreme.
- Set big goals to require yourself to grow.
