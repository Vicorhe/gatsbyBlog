- An upper middle class professional man appears before the Nazi authority that has occupied his town and shows his credentials: his university degrees, his letters of reference from prominent citizens, and so on. The Nazi asks him, “Is that everything you have?” The man nods. The Nazi throws it all in the wastebasket and tells him: “Good, now you have nothing.” The man, whose self-esteem has always depended on the respect of others, is emotionally destroyed.
- We are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose how we will respond.
- Success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the byproduct of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.
- The condemned man, immediately before his execution, gets an illusion that he might be reprieved at the very last minute.
- Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.
- This intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find refuge from its emptiness, desolation and spiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past.
- A man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus, suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, not matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of suffering is absolutely relative.
- No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.
- The human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings.
- The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the sufferings it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add deeper meaning to his life.
- Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.
- A man who could not see the end of his “provisional existence” was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life.
- The unemployed worker, for example, is in a similar position. His existence has become provisional and in a certain sense he cannot live for the future or aim at a goal.
- As a result of unemployment, there is a phenomenon of deformed time - inner time - where a small time unit, a day for example, appears endless. A large time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly.
- A man who let himself decline because he could not see any future goal found himself occupied with retrospective thoughts.
- But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of life, opportunities which really did exist.
- An exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. It is a test of their inner strength. Make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph.
- Those who know how close the connection between the state of mind of a man - his courage and hope, or lack of them - and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can be a deadly effect.
- It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life — daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk or meditation, but in right action and in the right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the task which it constantly sets for each individual.
- No man and no destiny can be compared with any other destiny.
- Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and realize assets in this way. Sometimes, he must simply accept fate.
- The uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love.
- That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
- Human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have a meaning, and that infinite meaning of life includes suffering and dying, privation and death.
- A man for years had thought he had reached the absolute limit of all possible suffering has now found that suffering has no limits, and that he could suffer still more, and still more intensely.
- Logotheraphy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future.
- Not every conflict is necessarily neurotic; some amount of conflict is normal and healthy.
- Suffering may well be a human achievement, especially if the suffering grows out of existential frustration.
- To be sure, man’s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, precisely such tension is a prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is meaning in one’s life.
- He who has a **Why** to live can bear almost any how.
- I consider it a dangerous misconception if mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, “homeostasis,” I.e., a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. Not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.
- Boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychologists, more problems to solve than distress.
- What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment.
- One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment.
- Live as you were living already for a second time as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.
- The more one forgets himself — by giving himself to a cause to serve more or another person to love — the more human he is and the more the actualizes himself.
- We can discover this meaning town life in three different ways: 1. By creating a work or doing a deed 2. By experiencing something or encountering someone 3. By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering

- Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.
- We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed.
- When we are no longer able to change a situation — just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer — we are challenged to change ourselves.
- Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment in finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.
- Let’s make it perfectly clear, it is in no way that suffering is necessary to find meaning. It is only instead that meaning is possible inspire of suffering, provided that the suffering is unavoidable.
- Logotheraphy bases its technique called “paradoxical intention” on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and the hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.
- Inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish.
- We must make use of our capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor.
- “Unemployment neurosis”, originates in a twofold erroneous identification: being jobless was equated with being useless, and being useless was equated with having a meaningless life.
