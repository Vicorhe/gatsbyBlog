There’s this girl I’ve been seeing since September, just getting to know her, nothing concrete.

Today I found that she got into a relationship.

It’s only natural for everyone to look out for their best interests, I just made the assumption we were both in the same phase of getting to know each other.

The turn of events itself is neutral, but I couldn’t help but feel a bit down.

Knowing well this hiccup could jump start a rut, I talked myself out of it.

We over exaggerate our emotions during a crisis or any hard task. 

What often seems excruciating or impossible is taken for granted after the matter.

I experience this every time I’m on the treadmill.

Couple minutes into a run, I am hyper conscious of the discomfort and think:
- “I’m not going to make it”
- “My legs are gonna give out”
- “I’m going to hurt myself if I keep going”
- “My body can’t handle it anymore”
- “I have to stop right now” 
- “This is impossible”

Then I remind myself that I’ve completed the run yesterday, the day before that, and everyday of the previous week.

Anything short of an injury, I can do it again.

**We forget that we’ve been through the same trials in the past.**

In the the heat of the moment, it seems impossible to just ‘get over it.’ 

Yet you’ve done just that countless times.

It’s almost inevitable. 

Ten months from now, this hiccup will be a conversation topic at best, nothing more.
