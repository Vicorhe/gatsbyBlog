I originally intended to build a swiss army knife for activity tracking, journaling, blogging, and online pressence.

Then I realized I would need to Learn Gatsby, GraphQL, React, ... and maybe after a full weeks' work, I'll come up with a shoddy prototype only to abort the project for another 7 weeks.

**No thank you.**

Instead, I went with a habbit training app, a daily journal app, and a workout tracker, and this blog.

**I've struggled with the urge to implement everything from scratch in the past.**

Perhaps, it would vaidate me as true software engineer.

But, I wasn't solving interesting problems.

Why reinvent the wheel when it is being automated to near perfection aleady.

I rather move on to the juicy stuff.
