I originally intended this site to be a swiss army knife for activity tracking, journaling, blogging, and establishing an online pressence.

Then I realized I would need to learn Gatsby, GraphQL, React, ... and maybe after a full weeks' work, I'll come up with a shoddy prototype only to abort the project for another 7 weeks.

**No thank you.**

Instead, I settled for a habbit training app, a daily journal app, and a workout tracker app, and this blog.

**In the past, I've always struggled with the urge to implement everything from scratch.**

I would think, perhaps, it would vaidate me as true software engineer.

And yet, I wouldn't be solving any interesting problems.
