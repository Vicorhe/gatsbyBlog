I have been rather conflicted for the past two months.

Most of the time, I see my current partnership as a once in a life time opportunity. And wish to succeed in this venture and achieve something substatial.

Other days, I yearn for a strady corporate position, where I know exactly what I need to do and exactly how much of a reward for the effort. 

I confronted my mother to discuss this matter.

She ingeniously replied with a **wager**.

*Are you willing to bet all your potential profit above 100k in return for covering your living epenses over the next 2 years?*

**HELLLL NAAAWWWW**

Mother wouldn't be risking much if I were to fail. 

More importantly, my response awakened my determination to succeed with flying colors.
