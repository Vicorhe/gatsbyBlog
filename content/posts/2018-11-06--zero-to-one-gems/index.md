- Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work — going from 1 to n.

- Horizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like.

- Vertical to intensive progress means doing new things —  going from 0 to 1. 

- Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it requires doing something no one else has ever done.

- The single word for horizontal progress is globalization — taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere.

- The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology.

- Most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.

- A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.

- A startup has to question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.

- The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lessons from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:
    - Make incremental advances
        - Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.
    - Stay lean and flexible
        - All companies must be ‘lean,’ which is code for ‘unplanned.’ You should not try things out, ‘iterate,’ and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.
    - Improve on the competition 
        - Don’t try to create a new market prematurely. The only only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.
    - Focus on the product, not sales
        - If your product requires advertising or sales people to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.

- The opposite advice may still help
    - It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
    - A bad plan is better than no plan.
    - Competitive markets destroy profits.
    - Sales matters just as much as product.

- We still need new technology, and we my even need some 1999-style hubris and exurberance to get it. To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash.

- Ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

- So called perfectly competitive markers achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer demand. Every firm in a competitive market is undifferentiated and sells the same homogeneous products. Since no firm has any market power, they must all sell at whatever price the market determines.

- Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.

- The opposite of perfect completion is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no  competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes profits.

- If you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.

- The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.

- If you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating factors, you business is unlikely to survive.

- Non-monopolies exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets.

- Monopolies, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as a union of several large markets.

- All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

- Creative monopoly means news products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator. 

- Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival. 

- Competition is an ideology - the ideology - that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it - even though the more we compete,the less we gain. 

- The hazards of imitative competition may partially explain why individuals with Asperger's like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in Silicon Valley today. If your are less sensitive to social cues, you're less likely to do the same things as everyone around you. If you're are interested in making things or programming computers, you'll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them. Then when you apply your skills, you are a little less likely than others to give up your own convictions: this can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes. 

- Every monopoly has a combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economic effects, economics of scale, and branding. 

- A good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. - the clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. 

- You can radically improve an existing solution: once you're 10x better, you'll escape competition. 

- Network effects make a product more useful as more people use it. 

- Network effects businesses must start with especially small markets. 

- A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed costs of creating a product (engineering, management, office space) can be spread out over ever greater quantities of sales. 

- A company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim monopoly. 

- Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. 

- Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. 

- It was much easier to reach a few thousand people who really need our product than to try to compete for the attention of millions of scattered individuals. 

- The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by a few or no competitors. Any big market is a bad choice, and a big market already served by competing companies is even worse. 

- The most successful companies make the core progression 

- To first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets 

- A part of their founding narrative. 

- As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible. 

- Moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. It's much better to be the last mover 

- That is, to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits.

- Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances...Strong men believe in cause and effect. 

- When we debate historical questions like these, luck is in the past tense. Far more important are questions about the future: is it a matter of chance or design? 

- If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it. 

- In middle school, we're encouraged to start hoarding "extracurricular activities." In high school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear omni-competent. By the time a student gets to college, he's spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse resume to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he's ready - for nothing in particular. 

- Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive - to be a monopoly of one. 

- Europeans just react to events as they happen and hope things won't get worse. The indefinite pessimist can't know whether the inevitable decline will be fast or slow, catastrophic or gradual. All he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat drink, and be merry in the meantime: hence Europe's famous vacation mania. 

- A definite pessimist believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it. 

- To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better. 

- To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn't know how exactly, so he won't make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely. 

- Instead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite-optimists rearrange already-invented ones. 

- Definite optimism works when you build the future you envision. Definite pessimism works by building what can be copied without expecting anything new. Indefinite pessimism works because it's self fulfilling: if you're a slacker with low expectations, they'll probably be met. But indefinite optimism seems inherently unsustainable: how can the future get better if no one plans for it? 

- Leanness is a methodology, not a goal. Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won't help you find the global maximum. 

- Jobs saw that you can change the world though careful planning, not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others' successes. 

- Long term planning is often undervalued by our indefinite short term world. 

- A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random. 

- The power law - so named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions - is the law of the universe. 

- The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined. 

- This implies two very strange rules for VCs. First, only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund. Rule number two: because, rule number one is so restrictive, there can't be any other rules. 

- Investors who understand the power law make as few investments as possible. 

- An individual cannot diversify his own life by keeping dozens of equally possible careers in ready reserve. 

- You should focus relentlessly on something you are good at doing, but before you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future. 

- People who understand the power law will hesitate more than others when it comes to founding a new venture: they know how tremendously successful they could become by joining the very best company whole it's growing fast. The power law means the difference between companies will dwarf the differences in roles inside companies. 

- Modern people are depressed because all the world's hard problems have already been solved. What's left to do is either easy or impossible, and pursuing those tasks is deeply unsatisfying. What you can do, even a child can do; what you can't do, even Einstein couldn't have done. 

- First is incrementalism. From an early age, we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed one very small step at a time, day by day, grade by grade. If you overachieve and end up learning something that's not on the test, you won't receive credit for it. But in exchange for doing exactly what's asked of you (and doing it just a bit better than your peers), you'll get an A. 

- Second is risk aversion. People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. 

- Third is complacency. 

- Fourth is "flatness." As globalization advances, people perceive the world as one homogeneous, highly competitive marketplace: the world is "flat." Given that assumption, anyone who might have had ambition to look for a secret will first ask himself: if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn't someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already? This voice of doubt can dissuade people from even starting to look for secrets in a world that seems too big a place for any individual to contribute something unique. 

- To say that there are no new secrets left today would mean that we live in a society with no hidden injustices. 

- If your think something hard is impossible, you'll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth. 

- Natural secrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don't know about themselves or things they hide because they don't want others to know. 

- The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. Most people think only in terms of what they've been taught; school itself aims to impact conventional wisdom. 

- Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it's rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything thing that you know. 

- So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, an no more. In practice, there's always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody - and that's the company. 

- When you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is whom to start it with. 

- Technical abilities and complementary skill sets matter, but how well the founders know each other and how well they work together matter just as much. Founders should always share a prehistory before they start a company together - otherwise they're just rolling dice. 

- To anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it's useful to distinguish between three concepts: 
    - Ownership: who legally owns a company's equity? 
    - Possession: who actually runs the company on a day to day basis? 
    - Control: who formally governs the company's affairs? 
    
- A typical startup allocates ownership among founders, employees, and investors. The managers and employees who operate the company enjoy possession. And a board of directors, usually comprising of founders and investors, exercises control. 

- Cash is attractive. It offers pure optionality: once you get your pay check, you can do anything you want with it. However, high cash compensation teaches workers to claim value from the company as it exists instead of investing their time to create new value in the future. A cash bonus is slightly better than a cash salary - at least it's contingent on a job well done. 

- The founding moment of a company, however, really does happen just once: only at the very start do you have the opportunity to set the rules that will align people toward the creation of value in the future. 

- The most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention that is most characteristic of beginnings. 

- Since time is your most valuable asset, it's odd to spend it working with people who don't envision any long term future together. If you can't count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven't invested you time well - even in purely financial terms. 

- General and undifferentiated pitches don't say anything about why a recruit should join your company instead of many others. 

- The only good answers are specific to your company. 

- But there are two general types of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. You'll attract employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling: not why it's important in general, but why you're doing something important in general, but why you're doing something important that no one else is going to get done. 

- From the outside, everyone in your company should be different in the same way - a tribe of like minded people fiercely devoted to the company's mission. 

- Startups have limited resources and small teams. They must work quickly and efficiently in order to survive, and that's easier to do when everyone shares an understanding of the world. 

- On the inside, every individual should be sharply distinguished by her work. 

- Defining roles reduce conflict. 

- But entrepreneurs should take cultures of extreme dedication seriously. 

- People at a successful startup are fanatically right about something those outside it have missed.

- Like acting, sales works best when hidden.

- Complex sales: if your average sale id seven figures or more, every detail of every deal requires cose personal attention.

- Personal sales: most sales are not aprticularly complex: average deal sizes might range between $10,000 and $100,000, and usually the CEO won't have to do all the selling himself. The challenge here isn't about how to make any particular sale, but how to establish a process by which a sales team of modest size can move the product to a wide audience. 

- Distribution doldrums: between personal sales (salespeople obviously required) and traditional advertising (no sales people required) there is a deadzone.

- Marketing and advertising work for relatively low-priced products that have mass appeal but lack any method of viral distribution.

- Viral marketing: a product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too.

- One of these methods is likely to be far more powerful than every other for any given business: distribution follows a power law of of its own.

- Just as you can never expect people to buy a superior product merely on its obvious merits without any distribution strategy, you should never assume that people will admire your company without a public relations strategy.

- All of us want to believe that we make up our own minds, that sales doesn't work on us. But it's not true. Everybody has a product to sell - no matter whether you're an employee, a founder, a founder, or an investor.

- Computers are compliments for humans, not substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.

- Computers are tools, not rivals.

- When we design new computer technology to help solve problems, we get all the efficiency gains of a hyperspecialized trading partner without having to compete with it for resources.

- Computers can find patterns that elude humans, but they don't know how to compare patterns from different sources or how to interpret complex behaviors.

- The most valuable companies in the future won't ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they'll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems.

- Seven questions that every business must answer:
    - The Engineering Question - Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental technology?
    - The Timing Question - Is now the right time to start your particular business?
    - The Monopoly Question - Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
    - The People Question - Do you have the right team?
    - The Distribution Question - Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
    - The Durability Question - Will your market position be defensible in 10 and 20 years into the future?
    - The Secret Question - Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?

- A great technology company should have proprietary technology an order of magnitude better than its nearest substitute.

- If you can't monopolies a unique solution for a small market, you'll be stuck with vicious competition.

- You can't dominate a submarket if it's fictional, and huge markets are highly competitive, not highly attainable.

- The best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.

- An entrepreneur can't benefit from macroscale insight unless his own plans begin at the micro-scale.

- A valuable business must start by finding a niche and dominating a small market.

- The lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should be more tolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual individuals to lead companies beyond mere incrementalism.

- The lesson for founders is that individual prominence and adulation can never be enjoyed except on the condition that it may be exchanged for individual notoriety and demonization at any moment - so be careful.

- Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better - to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.
